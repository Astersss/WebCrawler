According to the former senior intelligence official, who has access to sensitive information, “Cheney began getting messages from the Israelis about pressure from Obama” when he was President-elect. Cheney, who worked closely with the Israeli leadership in the lead-up to the Gaza ar, portrayed Obama to the Israelis as a “pro-Palestinian,” who would not support their efforts (and, in private, disparaged Obama, referring to him at one point as someone who would “never make it in the major leagues”)."	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2507212	Mon, 30 Mar 2009 15:12:44 -0800	CunningLinguist	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2507226 <em>Cheney, who worked closely with the Israeli leadership in the lead-up to the Gaza ar, portrayed Obama to the Israelis as a “pro-Palestinian,” who would not support their efforts (and, in private, disparaged Obama, referring to him at one point as someone who would “never make it in the major leagues”)."</em>Yeah, fuck that guy.	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2507226	Mon, 30 Mar 2009 15:17:31 -0800	Astro Zombie	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2507246 <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/go-back-into-hiding-gop-begs-dick-cheney--please-2009-03-23.html">Who's zoomin' who?</a>	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2507246	Mon, 30 Mar 2009 15:25:14 -0800	netbros	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2507385 <em>Cheney, who worked closely with the Israeli leadership in the lead-up to the Gaza ar...</em>You know, the idea that the Israelis would work closely with and be friendly toard Cheney is one of the most damaging allegations I've heard about them.

Maybe that's why Hersh still has it in for them. Not that he would need an excuse. Still, I was hoping the Fresh Air interview would at least touch on that; what does he say about those stories now?	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2507653	Mon, 30 Mar 2009 20:51:53 -0800	atchafalaya	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2507720 Hersh kept us out of Iran.

Every now and then it gets an answer. Cheney is the fuck. Seriously. The dude is the anti-strategist. He is Opposite Man.	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2507869	Tue, 31 Mar 2009 03:27:44 -0800	srboisvert	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2508181 <i>I still think Hersh was misled by Cheney et al into writing those stories about how we were going to invade Iran. </i>My feeling is that he was accurately reporting on what Cheney et al wanted to do, but were never able to do. I have little doubt that the plans were in place.<i>Hersh kept us out of Iran.</i>I think it's more like circumstances in Iraq kept us from hitting Iran. If Iraq had gone as smoothly as Cheney and Rumsfeld thought it was going to, I don't think Hersh's articles would have kept the Bush administration from launching a strike. But as things kept getting worse, there was less and less will to open another front, and that last NIE was the final nail in the coffin. Hersh deserves credit for his reporting, but I don't think he single-handedly prevented another ar. We'll probably never know for sure.	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2508181	Tue, 31 Mar 2009 10:01:29 -0800	homunculus	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2508227 And speaking of circumstances in Iraq, <a href="http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/03/30/iraq_the_unraveling">Iraq: the unraveling?</a>	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2508227	Tue, 31 Mar 2009 10:41:26 -0800	homunculus	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2508236 <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200903u/netanyahu">Netanyahu to Obama: Stop Iran—Or I Will</a>	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2508236	Tue, 31 Mar 2009 10:44:21 -0800	homunculus	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2509000 <i>Hersh kept us out of Iran.</i>Perhaps a bit of an oversimplification. Tell you one thing though: Ol' Dick Nixon kept our boys out of Northern Ireland, and for that we owe him plenty.Speaking of Syria, though, I recommend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oittinen/">europic's flickr sets</a> for an interesting and intimate look at the country from street level.	comment:www.metafilter.com,2009:site.80442-2509000	Tue, 31 Mar 2009 18:10:14 -0800	flapjax at midnite	http://www.metafilter.com/80442/A-chance-for-a-Middle-East-peace#2509441 Sy Hersh might be the most credible journalist in print today. Like the above posters, I have no doubt that the plans were in place, but forced to be tabled because of current political situation. Having lived in Syria for a third of my life (4 months a year, every year), i can say the country is ripe for US contact. It is not the same Syria as was under his father. The Golan Heights are still a sticking point, but the population as a whole want to reach a peaceful solution with Israel.
